# Parkinson Disease

Parkinsons is a disease that can cause a nervous system disorder and affects the movement. Parkinson dataset contains biomedical measurements, 195 records of people with 23 different attributes. This data is useful in differentiating healthy people and people with Parkinsons disease.

## Motivation

The reason behind using making this project is to learn and enhance the capabilities of XGBoost machine learning algorithm. XGBoosts stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting which is based on decision trees. In this I tried to implement the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification

## Dataset

Dataset is taken from UCI ML Repository.The dataset has 24 columns and 195 records.

## Prerequisites

We have to pip install sklearn xgboost.

##Summary
In this we learned to detect the parkinson's disease in individual factors. This gives an accuracy of 94.87%.
